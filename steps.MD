Postman Testing
---
In this project, we used Postman as the primary tool for working with the APIs. This tool serves as a bridge to communicate on different APIs, allowing users to perform the CRUD or Create, update and delete. With the Postman interface, it makes working with the API easier as you can organize API requests into collections, automate testing and work with the team.

Steps:
---
Create:
- **Workspace** - is a shared environment where teams can collaborate on API development, testing, and documentation.

- **Collection** - is a group of related API requests for easy testing and sharing

- **Perform connection test** - this will verify that the API is accessible and functioning correctly before proceeding with further testing
